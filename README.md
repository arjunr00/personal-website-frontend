# Website Template

This is a React-based frontend for my personal website at [*TBA*](example.com).
Everything's written in TypeScript and Sass, with Webpack for bundling.

## Design

I have a design for this website over on Figma, available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XBzmHgzkKn8wXyH6EJAW9r/Personal-Website?node-id=0%3A1).

## Usage

Click [this link](https://github.com/arjunr00/website-template/generate) (or the button labeled **Use this template** above) to generate a new repository using this one as a template.
Once you've got your repository set up, use `git clone` to clone it onto your local machine.

Run `yarn install` to install all packages.
Then run `yarn start` to start the website at `localhost:8080`, or run `yarn build` to generate a production version of the site at `dist/`.
